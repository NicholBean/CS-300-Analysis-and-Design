# CS-300-Analysis-and-Design Read Me
### By Nicholas Bean

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this project, the academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABC University (ABCU) requested a software to assist them with accessing course information for students. This software would store the file of courses, present them in alphanumeric order, and display the prerequisites of a selected course. 

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

This program was first approached through designing pseudocode for different three different data structures; Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree. These three data structures would be researched and have pseudocode designed to understand how each data structure would handle the same functions. It was important to understand these data structures because each of them have their pros and cons depending on different situations and their variety of tools.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

A few roadblocks I had while going through this project was designing my pseudocode for all of the data structures on each milestone, each having their own issue on missing components or potential memory leaks that needed tidied up. These roadblocks were later revised in Project One, where they had to be updated and presented again for ABCU to compare.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My work on this project has expanded my approach with designing software by having me understand the careful planning that goes into designing software. Understanding the components of different data structures informed me about the benefits and drawbacks of each and allowed me to select what would be most fitting for the situation. 

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My work on this project evolved the way I design maintainable, readable, and adaptable code by developing the pseudocode for different functions in the program, since they can provide me a layout of that makes designing code easier. The pseuodocode can also be used to pull comments from, labeling what different parts of functions can do.
